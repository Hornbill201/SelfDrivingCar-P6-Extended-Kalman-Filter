## Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5
 * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./ExtendedKF path/to/input.txt path/to/output.txt`. You can find
   some sample inputs in 'data/'.
    - eg. `./ExtendedKF ../data/sample-laser-radar-measurement-data-1.txt output.txt`

## Files in the `src` Folder

* `main.cpp` - reads in data, calls a function to run the Kalman filter, calls a function to calculate RMSE
* `FusionEKF.cpp` - initializes the filter, calls the predict function, calls the update function
* `kalman_filter.cpp` - defines the predict function, the update function for lidar, and the update function for radar
* `tools.cpp` - function to calculate RMSE and the Jacobian matrix

## How the Files Relate to Each Other
Here is a brief overview of what happens when you run the code files:

* `Main.cpp` reads in the data and sends a sensor measurement to FusionEKF.cpp
* `FusionEKF.cpp` takes the sensor data and initializes variables and updates variables. The Kalman filter equations are not in this file. `FusionEKF.cpp` has a variable called `ekf_`, which is an instance of a KalmanFilter class. The `ekf_` will hold the matrix and vector values. We also use the `ekf_` instance to call the predict and update equations.
* The KalmanFilter class is defined in `kalman_filter.cpp` and `kalman_filter.h`.
